Music Download Tool Product Description
 
Product Advantages
 
- Easy to use: With just one click, users can initiate downloads. No complicated settings are required, and files are automatically saved to the default download folder on the local device, greatly lowering the usage threshold.
- Cross-platform support: Compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux and other operating systems, meeting the needs of users in different environments.
- Flexible storage: The server-side storage path can be customized through configuration files, making it convenient for administrators to adjust the storage location according to actual conditions while ensuring standardized file storage.
- Clear process: The entire download process, from the user's request to the file being transferred to the local device, is transparent and controllable, allowing users to keep track of the file status.
- Stable and reliable: The server is equipped with error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure the stability of the download process and reduce download failures caused by unexpected issues.
 
Product Disadvantages
 
- Server storage usage: Files on the server remain until manually cleaned up or removed by scheduled tasks. If not cleaned for a long time, they may take up a lot of disk space.
- Dependence on network environment: The download process relies on a stable network connection. Network fluctuations may result in slow download speeds or interruptions.
- Lack of personalized download settings: Currently, users cannot customize the local download directory, which can only be saved to the system's "Downloads" folder, leaving room for improvement in flexibility.
 
User Guide
 
1. Start downloading: On the front-end interface of the music download tool, find the target song and click the corresponding download button. The front-end will automatically send a download request to the back-end API.
2. Wait for processing: After receiving the request, the back-end will obtain the song file from the music platform and save it to the  music_downloads  directory on the server (default path, customizable).
3. Receive the file: After the back-end completes file storage, it will return the file path to the front-end. The front-end will automatically trigger file download, transferring the file from the server to the user's local device. Finally, the file will be saved to the default download directory of the user's device:
- Windows:  C:\Users\<Username>\Downloads\ 
- macOS:  /Users/<Username>/Downloads/ 
- Linux:  /home/<Username>/Downloads/
